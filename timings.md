256x256 < 37 Seconds, ~166% speedup over prior release

384x384 < 2 Minutes 25 Seconds ~180% speedup over prior release

All times taken from fresh game launch with external android stopwatch for minimal game impact, on a Ryzen 5950x at 4.4Ghz (allcore).  YMMV.

PC Codename: Spud

CPU: i3-6100U @2.30 Ghz

This PC struggles far more to load the map than to generate it.  Generation takes less than half the load time.  Times are complete however (generation + loading, menu click to map).

128x128: < TBA

256x256: < TBA

384x384: < TBA

All times measured externally by android stopwatch to minimize impact on potato computer.
