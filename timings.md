PC Codename: Supreme

CPU: Ryzen 5950x

RAM: 64GBs of DDR4-3200

GPU: RTX 3090ti

128x128 < 8 Seconds, ~125% improvement

256x256 < 53 Seconds, ~75% improvement

384x384 < 4 Minutes, 1 Second ~35% improvement

All times taken from fresh game launch with external android stopwatch for minimal game impact, on a Ryzen 5950x at 4.4Ghz (allcore).  YMMV.

PC Codename: Spud

CPU: i3-6100U @2.30 Ghz

4GBs of ram.  

GPU: Potato.

This PC struggles far more to load the map than to generate it.  Generation takes less than half the load time.  Times are complete however (generation + loading, menu click to map).

128x128: < 50 Seconds, ~74% improvement

256x256: < 3 Minutes 44 Seconds, ~50% improvement

384x384: Not attempted anymore with these specs.

All times measured externally by android stopwatch to minimize impact on potato computer.
