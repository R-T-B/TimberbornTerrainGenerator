This PC struggles far more to load the map than to generate it.  Generation takes less than half the load time.  Times are complete however (generation + loading, menu click to map).
128x128: <1min 27seconds
256x256: <5min 36seconds
384x384: Crash at <12min 29seconds.  Generation succesful, the file is present on the computer and loadable on another one, but the game could not load it on such a potato.  Logs indicate it ran out of memory.

All times measured externally by android stopwatch to minimize impact on potato computer.
